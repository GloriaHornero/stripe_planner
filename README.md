# Stripe planner

Stripe planner allows you to create plans in [Stripe](www.stripe.com) from the command line.

Features:
 - Create new plans from scratch in one/multiple accounts in one go.
 - Copy existing plans between different accounts.
 - Dump all plans between different accounts.

This comes as a necessity we have at [Typeform](www.typeform.com), where we have different testing
environments which use the "test" mode of different stripe accounts.
This tool saves us the time of manually creating plans in each of those accounts
everytime we need to add new plans.

PS: This tool is still in WIP stage, so use at your own risk
